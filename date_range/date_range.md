## date_range() in pandas
Generating Sequences of Dates:

## date_range() 
It is used to create sequences of dates or timestamps. It generates a DatetimeIndex based on specified parameters.

**Parameters :**

1. start: The starting date of the sequence.

2. end: The ending date of the sequence.

3. periods: The number of periods (timestamps) to generate.

4. freq: The frequency of the data. It can be specified as a string (e.g., 'D' for day, 'H' for hour) or as a DateOffset object.

Specifying Start and End:

You can specify a start date and end date, and date_range() will generate a sequence of dates within that range. The generated dates will include both the start and end dates.

## Specifying Periods

Instead of specifying an end date, you can provide the number of periods you want to generate. The function will then create a sequence of dates with the specified number of elements.
Specifying Frequency:

The freq parameter allows you to specify the frequency of the dates. It can be a string representing a frequency alias (e.g., 'D' for day, 'H' for hour) or a DateOffset object.
Common Frequency Strings:

'D': Day

'H': Hour

'W': Week

'M': Month

'Y': Year

'T' or 'min': Minute

'S': Second

## DateOffsets:

The freq parameter can also take a DateOffset object, providing more flexibility in defining custom frequencies and offsets.
Inclusive vs. Exclusive Ranges:

By default, the generated date range is inclusive of both the start and end dates. You can adjust this behavior using the closed parameter.
Time Zone Handling:

date_range() can also handle time zones. You can specify a time zone using the tz parameter.
Use Cases:

Generating time indices for time series data.
Creating date sequences for plotting and visualization.
Providing a date range as an input to pandas functions that require a DatetimeIndex.
